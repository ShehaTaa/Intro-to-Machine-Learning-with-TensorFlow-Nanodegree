# Intro-to-Machine-Learning-with-TensorFlow-Nanodegree

## This program consists of 3 main parts:-
##  1- Supervised Learning:- 
   - Linear Regression
   - Perceptron Algorithms
   - Decision Trees
   - Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machines
   - Ensemble of Learners
   - Evaluation Metrics
   - Training and Tuning Models
   ## Project:- 
   ### Finding Donors for CharityML
    Apply supervised learning techniques on data collected for the US census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity   organization) identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause.
###  2- Neural Networks and deep learning
###  3- Unsupervised Learning
