   ## Project:- 
   ### Finding Donors for CharityML
    CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide  financial support for people eager to learn machine learning.
    Project goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
